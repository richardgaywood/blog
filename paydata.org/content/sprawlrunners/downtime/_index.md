1. Characters complete a mission, and receive compensation in the form of a [Payout]({{< ref "payouts.md" >}}). \
\
In-game, this might be hard currency, nuyen, financial instruments like bearer bonds, or a barterable asset such as advanced pharma or even nonpublic information of value to someone the characters know.
1. After the mission, the characters launder the Payout through various channels into untraceable liquid cash. \
\
Most of this cash is used to fund their [Lifestyle]({{< ref "lifestyle.md" >}}). Thie represents not only their day-to-day living but also [Lifetyle Perks]({{< ref "lifestyle.md#perks" >}}), which can help during missions.
1. Between missions, the characters have [Downtime]({{< ref "downtime.md" >}}). \
\
During Downtime, they can spend their time [Downtime Actions]({{< ref "downtime.md#actions" >}}). They can rest, recuperate, prepare for the next mission, and maybe even do a little good on the world -- for whatever their personal value of "good" may be. The bigger the Payout, the longer the Downtime, and the more Downtime Actions they can do.

Sprawlrunners uses a fully abstracted resource system, replacing the traditional RPG structure of buying gear and tracking a currency balance with a mechanic called *Logistic Points*. This works well for some tables, but we found it a little jarring for the characters to have no reason to discuss or negotiate the in-game payments for the jobs they undertake.

The rules in this section consist of several linked systems that work together to nudge the feel of Sprawlrunners a little closer to how Shadowrun works, but still without requiring detailed tracking of the resources each character has to draw on.

1. Advancement tracking is moved from an "advance after each mission" model to "earn karma after each mission, spend karma to advance." This is very similar to how older editions of Savage Worlds used XP. This helps our table smooth out the rate of advancement, as we play short sessions -- and sometimes long missions that span many sessions.
2. In addition to their LP pool, each player has a Wealth Die (see SWADE pg 145). LPs are used to buy all illegal or quasi-legal gear, as before. The Wealth Die is used for other expenditures: bribing a bouncer, paying for a nice dinner, purchasing small/legal items, and so on.
3. When a character completes a mission, they typically receive an in-game payment from whoever hired them. This payment is _only_ used to determine how many Downtime Actions they get to take before their next mission.
4. In between each mission, the players get to use a number of Downtime Actions. These actions can be used to obtain bonuses (including to the Wealth Die, LP, or bonus karma points), advance the character, heal up, and a variety of other useful things. -->
