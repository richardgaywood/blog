## Currencies

Your character's wealth is represented by three different numbers.

### Payouts

When your characters complete missions, they will typically be paid for this in some form: nuyen on untraceable credsticks, a bundle of hard currency, or some high-value tradeable asset like black market pharma.

These are called Payouts and are used by your character to fund their lifestyle and subsist off between missions. You do not use Payouts to buy things directly; that is handled by your character's LP pool and Petty Cash (see below). 

Each point of Payout you earn from a mission buys you enough time off afterward to complete one of the below Downtime Actions. Missions typically give you 2-4 points of Payout. Once you've run out of Payout, it's time to go back and find some more work.

The exact in-universe amount of money that a Payout is worth isn't concretely defined and is flexible. As your character progresses and does bigger jobs to sustain a more comfortable lifestyle, the numbers go up, but the Payout points remain the same.

### Logistic Points (LP)

LP is an abstract currency that represents lots of things: cash used to buy gear, influence and trust with fixers and fences, favours owed to you, and your reputation as someone who can keep their trap zipped when asked where their illegal arsenal came from.

All gear used on a mission must be purchased with LP. Gear purchased with LP is carefully scrubbed and anonymised. It is clean and untraceable. Smart 'runners dispose of this gear after a mission because you don't want an inconvenient ballistics check resulting in some megacorp joining the dots on your crime sprees.

(For avoidance of doubt, all rules for LP are as per Sprawlrunners.)

### Petty Cash

LP is used to buy gear, but it isn't the only currency you have or need. Sometimes you need to slip the bouncer a few nuyen to let you past, or settle a big bar bill, or pay for a fancy restaurant for a meet with someone you need to con. For that there's Petty Cash, which represents your characters' on-hand funds.

If you run short, you can convert 1 LP to 10 points of Petty Cash. You cannot convert the other way. Any Petty Cash you have on hand at the end of a mission is reabsorbed into your Payout. You start each new mission, after Downtime, with 2+1d4 points of Petty Cash (unless modified by the Poor, Rich, or Filthy Rich edges.)

* Poor Hindrance - exactly 1 point of Petty Cash
* Rich Edge - 2+2d4 points of Petty Cash
* Filthy Rich Edge - 2+3d4 points of Petty Cash

*TODO: write that up in the Edges section!*

* 1 point of Petty Cash is worth about 100 nuyen; enough for one small bribe or a slap-up feast for the whole team at a strip mall noodle cart. 
* 3 points of Petty Cash is a big enough bribe to get some non-public information at small risk to the bribee. 
* 5 points is a pretty hefty bribe and is about a week's income for a gig-economy struggling wageslave.

## Downtime action list

{{% pageinfo %}}
A note for my players: you can roll Savage Worlds style dice in Slack with the syntax `/roll 1d6x + 1d8x`. Obviously, change the d8 for whatever your skill is. The `x` will make the dice exploding. This can be used for any downtime dice-rolling, as a more convenient option to Foundry.

### Attune spirits

An attuned summoner mage with the Initiate edge can journey to Astral space, explore a new metaplane, and learn its true name. From then on, they can summon spirits from that metaplane whenever they please. You can do this action multiple times in a single downtime phase if you want.

See [summoning traditions]({{< relref "summoning_traditions.md" >}}).

### Carouse

Your character decides to blow off some steam and celebrate still being alive. They spend an extended period of time indulging whatever hedonistic vices most appeal to them.

Take a one-step penalty to your [wealth die type]({{< relref "wealth.md" >}}) die for the next session.

There is no mechanical game benefit to carousing. This is deliberate ;)

**TODO: change**

### Hang out

You spend some quality time with your nearest and dearest. xxxx CONTACTS? xxxxx

### Lie low

If you attracted an unusually breathtaking amount of attention on the last run and so have a [Heat Die]({{< relref "heat_die.md" >}}), you will need to skip town for a while until the heat dies down. For one action, you can reduce the Heat Die by two steps. You can take multiple Lie Low actions if you want or need. Maybe be more subtle next time!

### Long-term project

Maybe your character is engaged in some sort of longer-term thing: researching something, making something, trying to create a spell... anything we've agreed upon.

We'll handle this a bit like a Dramatic Task in SWADE or a Clock in Blades in the Dark. You'll have some fixed number of segments to complete - you might or might not know how many, depending on what you are up to. For a single downtime action, you can make a Trait Test using any appropriate skill to work on the project.

Test success will tick a segment on the progress clock. On a Raise, you can tick a second segment (there's no extra effect for two or more raises.) On a critical failure, you lose one segment. You cannot spend Bennies on this roll.

<!-- 
### Network

You spend time working your contacts, buttering them up, making sure the next time you come calling they'll have the good stuff set aside for you.

Roll a standard Networking test (Persuasion or Intimidate vs target number 4). If you succeed, take bonus LP on the next mission according to the table below. For each raise, take a further bonus LP (again, as per below). You cannot spend Bennies on this roll.

No penalty for failures, but you can't try again; people have had enough of you for now. You can only do Network once in a given downtime.

| Character rank | LP bonus on Success | LP bonus on Raise |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Novice         | +1                  | 0                 |
| Seasoned       | +2                  | 0                |
| Veteran        | +3                  | +1                |
| Heroic         | +4                  | +1                |
| Legendary      | +5                  | +2                |

### Rest & recuperation

Each Healing roll takes one downtime action. (See SWADE pg 96 for full details.) Roll Vigor; success clears a Wound, each raise clears another Wound. 

Other characters can Support this roll if they also spend a downtime action. They will roll either the Healing skill or their arcane skill if they have the _healing_ power.

Characters with the Fast Healer Edge can make two Healing rolls for a single downtime action.

### Stash nuyen

Your character is saving up for a rainy day. Retirement? Paying off their dear old ma's mortgage? Up to you. They spend their downtime living thriftily so they can divert as much money as possible to their savings. If you want to work to a specific goal, let me know what it is, and we'll set up a clock to track progress towards it.
   
### Side hustle

Shadowrunner's skill sets can be used for more mundane activities than the epic, daring heists we play out at the table. Riggers can do courier work; streetsams can work as bodyguards; mages can provide protection services; deckers can skim low-security systems for paydata. The risks are minimal but the pay... well, it's minimal. But not quite nothing.

If your character spends their downtime on a side hustle, they can earn a little extra cash in their pocket. Choose an appropriate skill and roll. On a success, you get +5 Petty Cash. On a raise, you get +1 LP.

On a critical failure, something goes very wrong! You take a Wound. You can use another Downtime action to attempt to heal this, if you have any left.

You can only do Side Hustle once per downtime.

<!--
| Character rank | Petty Cash bonus on Success | LP bonus on Raise |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Novice         | +5                  | +1                 |
| Seasoned       | +5                  | +2                |
| Veteran        | +10                  | +3                |
| Heroic         | +10                  | +4                |
| Legendary      | +15                  | +5                |

### Train

You spend time honing your abilities. Choose any one skill you know. During your next mission, you get one free re-roll that can be used when a roll of that skill results in a failure. This stacks with any other re-rolls you might have.

If you don't use this training before the next downtime, it expires. 

You can only Train once per downtime, and hence only hold on to one re-roll at a time.
