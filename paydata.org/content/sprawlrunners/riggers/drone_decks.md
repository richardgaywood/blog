Basic idea: similar to cyberdecks, but cheaper. Several tiers with different LP costs. Each tier can load a different number of modules. Required in order to Jump In to anything wirelessly. Provides good bonuses to drones.

Modules ideas:

* Extended s-PAN range for drones only: 1km -> 10km
* Stealth: can hide s-PAN
* (maybe) Drone hacking: as Persuasion utility, but only works against drones 
* Firewall: adds Firewall stat as per Fighting utility (2 + 1/2 Hacking), but does not allow other uses of Fighting ie hacking things.
* Pilot: adds a wild die to drone autopilot piloting/driving/boating rolls 
* Gunnery: adds a wild die to drone Shooting rolls
