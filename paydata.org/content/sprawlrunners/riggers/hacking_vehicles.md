## Sleaze hacking

A successful [sleaze hack]({{< relref "../matrix/hacking.md" >}}) against an autopilot is sufficient to issue it a command of about one sentence length *or* to Jump In to it. If you issue a command, that command can be superseded by the vehicle's or drone's owners or occupants when they notice, of course. 

As usual, if the drone of vehicle is networked in a PAN, WAN, or s-PAN, that has to be dealt with (sleaze hacked or crashed) first.

## Cybercombat hacking

If a vehicle or drone's autopilot is crashed in cybercombat, then the autopilot and navigation is disrupted, but the occupants can still use manual controls to take over. Even if they don't, then a backup failsafe system will attempt to bring it to a safe halt. (It might fail though, they're quite basic.)

## Stealing cars

A single successful sleaze hack roll is enough to get a parked vehicle to unlock itself, disable the autopilot, and then activate manual controls. It can then be stolen. However, this comes with some severe caveats:

## Control hierarchy

1. Jumped In control
2. Manual controls inside a vehicle (whether physical or via an AR interface surface) 
3. Autopilot

Hence, hacking an autopilot and issuing it commands can be overridden by anyone inside the vehicle 

Similarly, if a rigger is jumped into a drone, hacking attacks cannot change
