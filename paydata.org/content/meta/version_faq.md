## What version of Shadowrun should I play?






## 


## First Edition (1989, FASA)





## Second Edition (1992, FASA)

_Sometimes described as “a polished version of first edition”, it’s close enough that a lot of game material and expansions barely need changing to work across both versions. However, there are still a good few differences._

## Third Edition (1998, FASA)



*   Chargen tool - [NSCRG](https://shadowrun3.webs.com/nsrcg)




## 


## Fourth Edition (2005, Wizkids) & Fourth Edition, 20th Anniversary (2009, Catalyst Game Labs)

_Note that the “20th Anniversary Edition” version of the Fourth Edition rules is essentially “the original rules plus errata and fixes”. You should definitely pick the 20A version._



*   A comprehensive chargen tool for 4e, [Chummer, is still available here](http:// github.com/chummer5a/chummer). It’s no longer updated but should work fine.

   <td>I’m going to keep this general… I don’t see the benefit of arguing about specific skills or anything. So...
<p>
One of the things I love about future fiction is that it tends to heavily reflect the time in which it was written. Old Atomic Age fiction is fascinating to read as a person of this time and place. 
<p>
Cyberpunk, and hence Shadowrun, is heavily rooted in the 80s. The hair, the punk, the neon, the dark dystopian future full of acid rain and big hair. 
<p>
But it’s not the 80s any more. It’s inevitable that Shadowrun updates to the times. It was getting rather silly that the cyberpunk future didn’t have wireless everything. We needed to capture the zeitgeist of our time. Cellphones are cheap and ubiquitous. Megacorporations know more about our shopping habits than we do. The problems with end stage capitalism are staring us in the face. And we can keep the neon, the hair, the ‘tude, etc. 
<p>
So, we update from 3e and we get wireless, AR, cheap computers, cheap drones. And a certain “Apple-ification” of tech, yes. 
<p>
Shadowrun had a problem. It was the “Everyone go get pizza, it’s time to do the decker minigame.” 
<p>
4e makes everything wireless and that gives the hackers stuff to do in combat. Hack the opposition’s ‘links, sign them up for spam, turn off their firewall, mess with their drones, listen in on their coms, disable their smartguns, etc etc etc. Judicious use of wifi blocking walls made it necessary for the hacker to come along for the ride too. 
<p>
Wireless and cheap computers allowed people to “rig” on the cheap. Nothing beats a dedicated rigger, but the Street Samurai could keep a couple of cheap drones for peeking around corners or watching the escape route. Everyone could, and that is futuristic and good. 
<p>
Virtual Reality is so…. Lawnmower man. 80s. AR is a more up to date and believable interface that lets you check out that hot elf chica’s social media profile on the dance floor, which fits the zeitgeist better. 
<p>
I get that many people like the tone of earlier editions, but tone is largely set at the table anyway. You can have neon and mohawks and punk with 4e rules. You just also get ubiquitous cell phones and network connectivity.
<p>
4e also did away with a priority character generation system. I think the point buy allows for more nuanced characters. I think priority gen forces stereotypical characters. 
<p>
I liked the metaplots. I thought the Brackhaven political stuff was interesting and plausible, for example.  
<p>
I think the 4e matrix rules make sense. I’m a techie by trade. I get the 4e matrix rules. They make sense. They’re not complex, but they ARE…. there’s a lot. Trying to explain all of that to my friends felt like I was trying to give them a networking certification. I get why 5e tried to simplify the matrix rules. I just think they made it worse…. 
<p>
So why not play 5e? 6e? 
<p>
The editing is atrocious. The 20A book had all the splat books in the main book index. You could look up anything from all the books in one spot. That is awesome. <em>(So does the 5e Master Index Edition, to be fair - penllawen)</em>
<p>
I find 5e and 6e hard to read. Again, the editing sucks. There’s too much gratuitous filler text, and they changed the background color to blacks and reds. Ooooohhhh. Edgy! Ugh. The language took a tone change too. I liked the “drek” of previous editions. Really though, after the beautiful editing and cross referencing available in the 20A book, reading 5e and 6e makes me angry…  Why? Why’d they have to mess up something so basic? It makes it so hard for new people... 
<p>
I already have all the splat books, and 5e/6e gave me gratuitous filler text instead of… gear, weapons, adept powers, etc that I had taken for granted as being “Standard”. I don’t appreciate being charged for something I already have.
<p>
The 4e Seattle book is awesome. I feel like 5e and 6e tried to go away from Seattle, but never released a good meaty book on other locations, so everything got kind of…. Fuzzy… for locations. That might just be me though. 
<p>
They brought back priority generation after 4e. The standard priority gen is… well, everyone uses alternatives for a reason. Try making a troll decker. You need high priority for Troll, you need high priority for money to afford the stupid expensive cyberdeck, and you still need stats and skills. It doesn’t work. So people use alternatives. Also, it felt like a naked attempt at “We’re going retro!” without a good reason to do so. 
<p>
Cyberdecks are expensive again. Some cyberware got more expensive too. Why? Tech gets cheaper, not more expensive with time! It beggars belief. It flies against the zeitgeist of the time. And again, it felt like a naked attempt at “Look at us, we’re going retro!” without a good reason to do so. 
<p>
I hate 5e limits. I loathe them. If they’re an attempt to cut down on power gaming munchkins, they suck at it and instead of saddling every single roll in the game with something to check, they could have just imposed limits on dice pools ONE time at character generation. If they’re an attempt at “realism”? They’re not needed, and they saddle every single roll in the game with something to check. They’re no benefit, high cost. 
<p>
I don’t like the 5e or 6e metaplots. They feel recycled. Another crash! Another Chicago, but with nanites this time! And 6e feels even worse. 
<p>
I don’t like the matrix Foundation runs. If I want to play Wild West or Fantasy or whatever, I’ll go play a different game. 
<p>
I don’t like the matrix rules. They don’t make SENSE, from a technical standpoint. They brought in moveable matrix stats, which is just more headache to keep track of. The matrix needed a simplification, not a completely new ruleset with completely new problems. 
<p>
I loved the 5e idea of grids. It brought in the Net Neutrality issues of our time. And then they did away with them…. 
<p>
I’m rambling…
<p>
4e20A. Better than 1-3e because of more believable tech, no pizza run/matrix time, better character generation. 
<p>
4e20A. Better than 5-6e because the editing doesn’t SUUUUUUCK, better character generation, more believable tech, no limits, and the plot isn’t recycled. Again.

## Fifth Edition (2013, Catalyst Game Labs)



*   5e is the most recent “complete” edition, in the sense that it has a full range of “splatbooks”: one or more per-character-archetype books that expand and deepen player options. Some characters (eg riggers) suffer quite a bit without their splatbook, so that can be important if you want that depth to the gameplay. On the other hand, it can also be overwhelming, and it’s often suggested that new players start out with just the core book and add splatbook content over time.
*   Speaking of overwhelming, at 500 pages, the 5e core book is by far the longest of any edition. Compounding the sheer bulk of the thing is poor organisation, with some rules broken into pieces and scattered through the book. This can be frustrating, especially at first.
*   A comprehensive chargen tool for 5e, [Chummer5, is available here](https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a). It’s highly recommended to take some pain out of chargen.
    *   Also, the output from chummer5 can be directly imported into roll20, if you are playing online. This can be a huge time-saver.
*   u/adzling has a [collection of SR5 cheat sheets here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xfdws0y69g2pmcm/AABFikEVtLBcQLqLtEEm0jOPa?dl=0).

<ul>

<li>While 5e is not without issues, it is in general a fully working, complete edition. Meaning there are a lot of supplement books you can use. A few of them are really good and pretty much spot on their theme (for example Chrome Flesh, Rigger 5.0, Street Grimoire).

<li>It has a large community and was the latest edition people generally consider playable. You can ask a lot of questions.

<li>A lot of the background material from 4e is compatible and the rules are often "close enough" to make easy adjustments. This means even more material for 5e.

<li>While 5e can be deep and crunchy at times, you can also easily handwave/ignore/change/simplify rules so it's working for your table.

<li>5e resembles our own world (technology!) closer than the old ones did. So if you're looking for a "projection of our world in a dystopian future" you're closer with 5e than with 2e.

  <tr>
   <td>5e is the most recent complete edition, as a result it has the most sourcebooks and most up-to-date vision of what the 6th World would like in relation to real life.
<p>
Core mechanics work pretty well and are quite simple and oddly elegant (attribute + skill = pool).
<p>
Situational modifiers that add or subtract from the dice pool are easily fine tuned by the GM, impose meaningful variables on the chance of success, and reflect the reality of the environment / world pretty well.
<p>
Success thresholds (how many successes you need to succeed) are easily understood and reasonably reflect the difficulty of succeeding at any particular task.
<p>
<strong>Combat:</strong>
<p>
In 5e speed (initiative / dodge), competency (dice pool) and resilience (armor and body) works as one would expect in a game that reflects “Matrix” movie style combats. Depth and nuance of character building allow you to build a “Neo” type who can literally dodge bullets or a “Hulk” who can shrug off smaller caliber firearms and light melee weapons. It’s “cinematic” but retains enough relation to reality that armor can stop bullets and a 600 pound Troll hits with more force than a 6 lb Pixie. Gear choices significantly affect the outcome and bear a reasonable relationship to action movie reality. While it’s possible to “break the game” by building for the extreme this is mostly controlled by the realities of the 6th World -- your GM isn’t going to let you walk down the street in heavy armor with an assault rifle or combat axe without attracting Lone Star and likely heading to jail. This creates the all-important dynamic of choosing your gear to suit the situation.
<p>
Weapons and armor include significant variance and customization options (important for the combat focussed PCs) that import meaningful choices on the player/ PC.
<p>
This nuance and depth is critical for delivering meaning to the combat focussed characters’ choices. It’s one of the shining successes of Shadowrun in general going all the way back to 1e.
<p>
<strong>Social:</strong>
<p>
One of the requirements of a heist type game like Shadowrun is usabe rules for social interaction and cons. Luckily 5e’s social rules don’t suffer from the inane rules bloat that other sub-areas do (looking at you, rigging and matrix). Social is mostly a question of opposed dice pools and modifiers and that’s just fine. Toss in some bonus modifiers for good RP and you’ve got all you need. Need more depth and nuance? Cutting Aces provides some good ideas on how to essentially use teamwork tests within the scope of conning someone.
<p>
<strong>Magic:</strong>
<p>
5e’s magic system is very similar to prior versions and works out of the box without modification, well almost. The core issue of “magicrun” (whereby magic trumps everything else) is an unfortunate side effect of the continuous expansion of magic power within the mechanics and supplements. You know this is a problem when all your players turn up to the table with a mage or mystic adept. There are some very easy ways to mitigate this via houserules (ban reagents for increasing limits, restrict the number of active spirits at once, ban mystic adepts, etc). You might not feel this too much if your players are relatively low-powered, but even straight out of chargen savvy players with mage characters can be almost obnoxiously powerful. This only gets worse the longer you play. GMs should keep a weather eye on it, lest the mage players start to overshadow the rest of the table.
<p>
<strong>Matrix:</strong>
<p>
While 5e’s Matrix does address the shortcoming of 4e’s script-kiddie syndrome that rendered deckers irrelevant, it feels like it was written by someone who was reaching for detailed, nuanced mechanics and edited by someone who failed to playtest it. The end result is a confusing mess of overly complex, nested systems that utterly fail to address the core aspect of any RPG; IT MUST BE FUN. The action economy also renders almost all Matrix activity less effective than just shooting the person / thing / target. The supplements help, a little, but it’s hard to fix the core rules without fixing, you know, the core rules. This is sad and a terrible miss in a game that is meant to embody a mashup of Cyberpunk and Fantasy. 
<p>
<strong>Vehicle chases / rules / rigging:</strong>
<p>
Perhaps the worst aspect of Shadowrun 5e, the entire vehicle rules section is utterly atrocious. Riggers are a confused mess where it’s not even clear what attributes to use with the various vehicle control options and even if you do figure it out / houserule it riggers still suffer from Multiple Attribute Dependency (MAD). The vehicle chase and movement rules are an example of what goes wrong with poorly abstracted mechanics. Due to this abstraction simple questions like “how fast does my vehicle go” are not even answered. Rules that were bolted on afterward in Rigger 5.0 don’t help much either. The Swarm rules are terrible from a balance perspective and inane from a common sense perspective. Overall it’s best to ignore the chase rules and heavily edit what’s used from the supplements.
<p>
<strong>Copy-Pasta:</strong>
<p>
Like all Catalyst Shadowrun products 5e suffers from extensive copy-pasta, resulting in rules that make no sense, that reference non-existent rules from prior editions and mechanics not matching the descriptions. The worst offender is the Street Grimoire but you will find this particularly pathetic example of editing in almost all Shadowrun products somewhere.
<p>
<strong>Perceived vs. Real complexity:</strong>
<p>
5e is perceived as a complex system, but is it? Yes and no. As you can see from above the core mechanics are very simple and easy to grok. The complexity comes from all the small details and the three overlapping subsystems of meat, matrix and astral. While those three subsystems have always been present in Shadowrun (and hence always upped the complexity level) it’s also true that 5e’s complexity was increased by the many “fiddly details” for these subsystems and the many supplements across which these are strewn. To some degree that’s what happens when a game has as many supplements as 5e does, however it’s exacerbated by Catalyst’s poor layout and editing. This is not unique to 5e, it’s present in all Catalyst products and is a product of their poor line editing in general. This can be dealt with to some degree by the judicious use of cheat sheets that summarize and condense these modifiers however it can be very daunting for someone learning the system for the first time. There are ways to manage this information overload by chunking how you learn Shadowrun into meat, matrix and astral sessions, using the aforementioned cheat sheets and simplifying/ hand-waving stuff you cannot remember in the moment.
<p>
<strong>The advantage of depth and nuance in an RPG:</strong>
<p>
So we’ve covered why Shadowrun in general and 5e in particular is complex and often perceived as more complex than it is. The question that follows naturally from this is “why would I want to play a complex system instead of one where I can learn it in one session”? The answer is nuance and depth. Systems that tilt towards simple are great for introducing new players but tend to be terrible for long term durability. In the end all characters of a specific type end up feeling the same with little differentiation. With 5e there are so many ways to build AND PLAY a character that they almost never feel or work the same. Everyone’s an individual with nuanced and unique options that drive characterization in a meaningful way.

## Sixth Edition (2019, Catalyst Game Labs)

   <td>Sooo…. 6e. The newest and without much doubt most divisive edition of Shadowrun with the big overarching goal of simplifying things. While having several similarities with 5e, it also features some huge changes.
<p>
The biggest of them is the new edge system. Instead of being a limited resource used for powerful effects, gaining and spending edge is now common during a session and can also be used for smaller effects, e.g. rerolling one die or increasing the number of a die by one. Many modifiers and qualities were changed in gaining edge and it is now a central part of the system. It also is the most debatable mechanic of the system, bringing its own slew of issues. Many of the problems I am mentioning later on are at least a bit tied to the edge system. Therefore, before starting with 6e, I highly recommend reading more about it beforehand. If the problems it creates might be a dealbreaker to you, don’t try this edition. Edge is so deeply embedded in 6e that it is nearly impossible to houserule it out without changing half of the book. 
<p>
I’m giving now a quick overview of the most mentioned pro’s and con’s of 6e. If not explicitly stated otherwise, you can assume that I share the public opinion due to my own experiences with the edition. \
 \
Pro’s
<ul>

<li>Simplified Skill List. That is especially positive for the matrix. Combat skills might be too grouped up for some though, when looking for houserules (and trust me, you WILL do houserules - but this is very likely true of any version of Shadowrun), you will sometimes see that combat skills are actually a bit split up again (including me). All in all though, it’s better than the 5e list.

<li>Simplified initiative and action economy. While true that it might not represent the speed of street sams enough and also has a sudden jump in damage output at a certain threshold, the reduced bookkeeping makes up for it.

<li>Handling of knowledge skills.

<li>German supplements for 6e. They are awesome, trust me. Go Pegasus! Yes, call me fanboy here, but they are really doing a great job. Also, the german core rulebook is laid out better and includes many (so far exclusive) errata. If you can speak german, you definitely have an advantage here.

<p>
Mixed opinions
<ul>

<li>“Simplification” of Matrix. Some say it’s noticeably simplified, others say it’s no better than 5e. For me, most of the noticeable simplification in the matrix is due to the simplified skill list and simplified initiative. Taking that out, the rest is only slightly simplified and slightly more intuitive due to rewording things, removing one mark/access level and removing grids. So yeah, it’s improved, but not as much as other ones let it seem in my opinion. Still, I take it :) However, I urge you to houserule matrix search, in its current state it’s broken and actually not intended to work this way.

<li>Attack Rating and Defense Rating. Some weapon stats are merged into Attack Rating, which describes the general effectiveness of weapons. Armor (and some other things) adds to Defense Rating. The concept of simplifying offensive and defensive stats this way is interesting, but in its current state, it’s heavily underbaked. It just determines the gain of one single point of edge (or the non-gain of it). Also, with the range of possible numbers being quite limited (base Attack Rating is from 1 to 14), weapons all feel the same. There was a tease though that in the incoming splatbook Firing Squad these two stats are getting more meaningful, so hope is not lost here.

<li>Priority table. A huge improvement here is that every metatype is available for Priority E to C. You can therefore always take the metatype you like without gimping your character. However, it has problems in other areas. Several options are near impossible to take for building a viable character (Attribute E), others are way too powerful or too cost effective (Attribute A, Metatype C). Humans are not a viable metatype. The options are therefore actually more limited than they already are due to using the priority table chargen. I just did an homemade version of karmabuy for my players. 

<p>
Con’s
<ul>

<li>Strength is almost meaningless. With the recent errata, there is nowhere a direct impact on the damage of melee attacks. The most it does is increasing your Attack Rating (a bit more on that later), which translates to an edge, which most times only translates to ⅔ of a hit. So basically a little child can challenge a dragon to a boxing match and both will do the same base damage. Other than that, it’s used almost nowhere. 

<li>Armor is almost meaningless. It isn’t relevant for the soak test anymore. That leads to problems like the ones we have for strength. If you ever see the joke of bikini trolls, it’s because of the crazy nerf to armor in 6e.

<li>Skills cost the same as attributes. Because an attribute affects several skills, it is something that just can’t be right.

<li>The majority of qualities and flaws are off at least karmawise and sometimes even effectwise. The usual suspects here are Analytical Mind, Focused Concentration and Impaired Attribute. Analytical Mind in its original form is so cost effective that in my opinion there is not a single character who should not take this quality. In Debt is nicely done though, really like this flaw.

<li>Confusing, missing or contradicting rules, While also true for (at least some of?) the other editions, 6e is the worst here. It is said sometimes that without knowledge of 5e, it is harder or even impossible to play 6e.

<li>Bad editing and layouting. Similar to the point before, while also true for 5e, it’s worse for 6e. German rulebooks excluded though.

<li>Rules contradicting shadowrun lore. By far the biggest offender here are the changes to bullets which would lead to a complete turnaround of the weapon industry lorewise without a reasonable benefit AND also violating rule zero of Shadowrun.

<li>Rules contradicting the design goal of simplification. Again, ammunition, which price calculation suddenly got an additional layer of complexity. It’s often said that 6e missed their design goal. For me, it’s only partially right because of the listed pro’s which are quite impactful. It’s also debatable if the edge system is a simplification or actually brings more complexity.

<li>Mages being even stronger than in 5e. Have to see it more in action, but so far, I would share that opinion. Direct combat spells are a total joke though.

<li>Driving rules. The amount of vehicles you can choose that have doable piloting tests for an average driver is quite limited. January errata did an essential buff to rigger controls though, so riggers are at least a bit playable now (but still in a bad position overall).

<p>
Keep in mind that right now we are in a phase where there can still come a potentially bigger amount of errata. So maybe, with just a bit of patience, some of the issues are going to be addressed. If you want to try it out now, DON’T buy the physical version as of now. Because the first printing is missing an huge amount of errata, it’s unusable. Get the PDF (which can be updated) and wait at least for the second printing if you like physical copies. That also applies to the german core rulebook.

## Appendix: alternatives

You have options beyond the six mainstream editions of core Shadowrun. (For even more than discussed here, see [this reddit thread](https://reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/fiddqk/big_list_of_shadowrun_alternatives/).)

First, there are hacks of Shadowrun into **rules-light narrative-first RPG engines**. These fall into two broad categories: 



1. _PbtAs_ (Powered By The Apocalypse), games that take mechanical inspiration from the seminal and influential RPG [Apocalypse World](http://apocalypse-world.com/). 
2. _FitDs_ (Forged in the Dark), which use mechanics from [Blades in the Dark](https://www.evilhat.com/home/blades-in-the-dark/)[^3].
This style of RPGs can be divisive; many people love them[^4], some find their light-touch GMing style and emphasis on narration over crunch to be too far away from the Shadowrun feel they crave. You’ve little to lose by checking them out though!

For SR play, a few rules-light narrative-first options I really like are:



*   [Shadowrun in the Sprawl](https://stuh42l.itch.io/shadowrun-in-the-sprawl/devlog) (donation) takes [The Sprawl](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/171286/The-Sprawl----MIDNIGHT) ($15) (a straight-up cyberpunk PbtA game) and blends in the urban fantasy elements we love about Shadowrun. You need those two books to play, but nothing else. It makes for an impressively breezy, fast-paced system - you can play out an entire run, soup-to-nuts, with a few complications and twists thrown in, in a few hours. But don’t mistake that for being easy on the players. They’ll still have to make hard, hard choices.
*   [Runners in the Shadows](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwzNN7yL3u8NdjBhX1Zzdlhfd3M) (free) is a Shadowrun-inspired FitD. You don’t need any other books to play this. This is quite a light touch hack, as the core Blades in the Dark book is already very close to Shadowrun anyway -- being a game about desperate criminals doing risky heists.

There’s also a few options if you want a more **rules-middling approach**, something with the same sort of density of crunch as (say) D&D 5e, but distinctly more than the PbtA/FitD approach.



*   Catalyst themselves have had a pass at this, in the form of [Shadowrun: Anarchy](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/194759/Shadowrun-Anarchy). As a system it has good bones but is criminally underbaked in lots of different ways. You’ll likely quickly find yourself looking for more houserules to bolt on. If so, start by taking a look at [Surprise Threat!](https://www.surprisethreat.com/), which has lots and lots of thoughtful suggestions. \
 \
The world would be a better place if the author of Surprise Threat! was given free reign to write Anarchy 2e, but we are where we are.
*   [Savage Worlds](https://www.peginc.com/product-category/savage-worlds/) (core book $10) is an entirely generic RPG engine which has numerous supplements and rulesets in all sorts of genres. One of those, [Interface Zero 3.0](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/288734/Interface-Zero-30-Players-Guide-to-2095) ($20), covers cyberpunk. Take those two, and add on [this (free) fan-made hack](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/fcho08/shadowrun_conversion_for_interface_zero_30/) (which cleverly uses pre-existing Savage World rules for fantasy elements like magic and metahumans) and you get yourself a pretty neat Shadowrun system.

## Notes

[^1]:
     I am not innocent of this, either.

[^2]:

     Pun intended. Sorry.

[^3]:

     An argument can be made that Blades in the Dark _is itself_ a PbtA, as although it doesn’t draw on Apocalypse World mechanically it definitely shares a lot of key design principles. But that’s a side-note here.

[^4]:
     I am one of those people.
