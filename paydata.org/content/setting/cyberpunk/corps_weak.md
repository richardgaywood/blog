Listen up, chummers and chooms.

E'rybody running around these days acting like the megas are the big hoo-rah.

## Corps are made of people...

...and people are messy. And malleable.

They can be cajoled, convinced, conned. They can be bribed, browbeaten, bypassed. They are greedy, they are weak, and they are vulnerable. Sometimes, just sometimes, they may even have a better nature you can appeal to.

When you go up against a corp, you're not up against a corp. You're up against some of the people within it. Work out who those people are, work out their vulnerabilities, and squeeze.

## Corps are not meritocracies

"We're the apex predators," they tell themselves. "The biggest, sleekest, nastiest sharks Earth has ever seen. We only promote the hungriest, the smartest, the most cunning. We're lead by the baddest motherfraggers around."

Bulldrek.

The corps promote the wageslaves who're best at playing the game of getting promoted, that's all it is. They're not finding the smartest, they're finding the ones who are the best at kissing ass, padding their quarterly reports, and having the right relatives. You think all those failsons and faildaughters swing their veep offices at the age of 24 from genuine merit? Please.

And what do these mediocre minds do once they're lording it over their division? Spend their days drinking whisky, being rude to their assistants, playing golf... and screwing up. Screwing up everything they touch.

Ever wonder exactly why so many top secret facilities you've, ahem, _professionally visited_ have obvious gaping holes in their security? Well zoom out, rewind, and do a background check on the exec who oversaw the security system design and install. One gets you ten, they're some overpromoted shitwits. One gets you _twenty_ that they found some underling to take the fall for your little incursion and were promoted upwards within the year.



## Corps are penny-wise but pound-foolish







## Hyper-capitalism: what does it mean?

Cyberpunk is often described as "hyper-capitalist dystopia." But what does that mean in practical terms? 

* **Short-term thinking:** corp culture is obsessively focussed only on the immediate future: next week's progress report, next month's exec review, next quarter's results. There is little long-term planning. If something makes today's numbers go up but causes problems in the future, well, that's a problem for future-corp to worry about.

## Internecine warfare
